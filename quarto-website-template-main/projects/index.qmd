title: About Noni
---

I currently coordinate a multisite clinical trial at Case Western Reserve University with the goal of evaluating a novel transdiagnostic treatment for co-occurring PTSD and depression. I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Clinical Research at CWRU with a focus on Clinical Psychology. 

Previously, I have assisted with research at the UNC Anxiety Lab to broaden the scientific understanding of OCD. There, I completed an Independent Study where I coordinated research evaluating electrodermal activity and behavioral compulsions in Relationship OCD. I also have assisted with minority youth mental health and identity development research at the UNC School of Social Work.

I have additionally had the privilege of serving as a community-based therapeutic mentor to adolescents at risk of attending residential mental health programs. 

I earned dual BAs in Psychology and Communications with a concentration in Media Production from UNC-Chapel Hill. Ultimately, I plan to pursue a Clinical Psychology PhD program, with a focus on investigating transdiagnostic mechanisms for OCD and PTSD. I also aim to research the development, adaptation, optimization, and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for traumatic stress and OCD, particularly those that integrate spiritual principles into treatment.

As a former digital marketer, I also have experience with video marketing, copywriting, design, digital advertising, PR, social media, photography, and copyediting. Now, I am passionate about bringing my analytical skills to conduct mental health research and my communication and creative skills to empower others in my clinical work.
