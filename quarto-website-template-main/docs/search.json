Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "I currently coordinate a multisite clinical trial at Case Western Reserve University with the goal of evaluating a novel transdiagnostic treatment for co-occurring PTSD and depression. I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Clinical Research at CWRU with a focus on Clinical Psychology.\nPreviously, I have assisted with research at the UNC Anxiety Lab to broaden the scientific understanding of OCD. There, I completed an Independent Study where I coordinated research evaluating electrodermal activity and behavioral compulsions in Relationship OCD. I also have assisted with minority youth mental health and identity development research at the UNC School of Social Work.\nI have additionally had the privilege of serving as a community-based therapeutic mentor to adolescents at risk of attending residential mental health programs.\nI earned dual BAs in Psychology and Communications with a concentration in Media Production from UNC-Chapel Hill. Ultimately, I plan to pursue a Clinical Psychology PhD program, with a focus on investigating transdiagnostic mechanisms for OCD and PTSD. I also aim to research the development, adaptation, optimization, and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for traumatic stress and OCD, particularly those that integrate spiritual principles into treatment.\nAs a former digital marketer, I also have experience with video marketing, copywriting, design, digital advertising, PR, social media, photography, and copyediting. Now, I am passionate about bringing my analytical skills to conduct mental health research and my communication and creative skills to empower others in my clinical work.\n \nNoni presenting research on the association between post-migration living difficulties and PTSD severity in Somali refugees at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies Conference in 2025"
